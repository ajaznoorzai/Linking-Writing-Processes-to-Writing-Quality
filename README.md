# Linking-Writing-Processes-to-Writing-Quality#




This study investigates the correlation between typing behaviour and essay quality by conducting a comprehensive analysis of keystroke dynamics in three experiments. Conventional
evaluations frequently disregard the ever-changing nature of writing, placing emphasis on the
end result rather than the ongoing process. This study seeks to emphasise the important but
frequently overlooked connection between the writing process and the quality of the finished
text by using thorough keystroke logs. The study postulates that typing dynamics, including rhythm, speed, and editing patterns, are important indicators of writing quality. These
dynamics act as immediate indications of the writerâ€™s cognitive processes, providing a fresh
viewpoint on writing proficiency. The initial experiment establishes fundamental correlations,
the subsequent experiment enhances the prediction model by employing sophisticated feature
engineering techniques, and the last experiment incorporates probabilistic classifiers to improve
the interpretation of features. This study seeks to question and transform current educational
paradigms by prioritising the process of writing, teaching, and assessment rather than focusing
solely on the end result. This project combines data science and cognitive linguistics in collaboration with Vanderbilt University and The Learning Agency Lab. Its aim is to potentially
revolutionise writing education in the digital era. The study identified that an ensemble model
combining multiple predictive algorithms outperformed single-model approaches
